###Useful Work flows for writing and reproducibility 

This could be a image gallery organized by tools or purpose of workflow.  It would be really cool to collect from people as through out the hackathon.  Maybe someone who is awesome at design could help with this.  If not, I can make them in illustrator pretty easy.

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4">
    <div class="thumbnail">
      <img src="/test/img/workflow1.png" alt="workflowDiagram">
      <div class="caption">
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>Tools: R, Pandoc, Markdown.  This is just an example.  It would be great if we could develop a way make workflows easy, so in the future more people could submit their workflows. </p>
